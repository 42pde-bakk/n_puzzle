# n_puzzle
We are going to create a program capable to solve n-puzzles of various sizes, as optimized as possible, 
except it won't be as optimal as possible since I'm doing it in Python


###Usage:

If you want to run it in a virtual environment do:
```shell script
python3 -m venv venv
```

Install the dependencies and run it like so:

```shell script
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 srcs/main.py puzzles/3.txt
```
